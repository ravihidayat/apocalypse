# Apocalypse

A shooting game where the player fights against enemies, spawned in a random manner. This was created in 2019, during my second semester as a final group project, with [@Baron](https://github.com/Barongobber) as one of the member, for Programming Technique with C++ class. The code itself utilizes graphics.h library, and written based off the OOP paradigm.
